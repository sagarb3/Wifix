Follow the link http://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-WiFi-Hotspot-Using-the-Command-Prompt to setup your via using cmd.Now in general cases you need to always use cmd to start and stop such wifi but by my code place the hta application on your desktop and in the hta file change the C:\Wifix\ to the address in your drive where you will be storing the mywifi.bat and stopmywifi.bat and now you have a gui to start and stop your cmd created wifi , also don't change the location of favicon.ico from the hta file.I hope you enjoy and would like for some better edit
